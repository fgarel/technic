# You can use 'named' colours, #rrggbb, #rgb or rgb(r%,g%,b%) format
m.background = mapnik.Color('steelblue')

# Now lets create a style and add it to the Map.
s = mapnik.Style()
# A Style can have one or more rules. A rule consists of a filter, min/max scale
# demoninators and 1..N Symbolizers. If you don't specify filter and scale denominators
# you get default values :
#   Filter =  'ALL' filter (meaning symbolizer(s) will be applied to all features)
#   MinScaleDenominator = 0
#   MaxScaleDenominator = INF
# Lets keep things simple and use default value, but to create a map we
# we still must provide at least one Symbolizer. Here we  want to fill countries polygons with
# greyish colour and draw outlines with a bit darker stroke.
